1. when click the menu to change router, the message popup will change its position where mouse is clicked
2. when direct to the chat window with the contact who sent the popUp, the popUp will not disapper. It should
disapper and the window should have what the popup includes as history.
3. The new message won't update as the route is not updateï¼ŒI used currentArray to deal with this, but it is a bit lagging for the popUp to disappear when clicking. Use this solution, the popUp message will not stick on the nav
item when change routing anymore, but the initial position is a problem. Try to add event listener, since the popup
disapper lagging is because of the onMouseMove
